Adeva Frontend Task

Getting Started

Each note has two properties, the note title which is shown on the notes list, and the note text which is the content of the note, the interface is very basic as it was not one of the points of evaluation, I focused on code and architecture.

- Run "yarn install" to install all dependencies and start the application.
- Rurn "yarn start" and go to http://localhost:3000/ to see the application.
- Run "yarn test a" to run all the tests cases

instructions:
- View note content: click on any note on the list on the left hand side
- Edit note: after clicking on any note just change its content and then click save
- Add note: click on the green Add Note button on top of the notes list and then fill the fields, finally click save (you       have to fill both note title and note text to enable the save button)
- Delete note: click on the "X" button next to the list item you want to delete
- you can look for a especific note by using the filter, it filters by both the note title and the text
